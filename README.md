subtitle_converter
==================

If you have a movie, then sometimes it comes with a subtitle file. However, there are several formats of subtitle files. We subtitle movies we use in training and usually we use Final Cut for that and they produce a movie file like the one attached, which is in STL format.

However, if you attach subtitle to a mkv file, then the format that is required is SRT. They are quite different, but the type of information is same (similar)

STL file format:
