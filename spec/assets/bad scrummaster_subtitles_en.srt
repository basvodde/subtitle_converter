1
00:00:04,825 --> 00:00:09,528
I have a problem, I can't get access to the error database at a consistent rate

2
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:10,825
Oh, that is not an impediment

3
00:00:10,858 --> 00:00:17,792
In this retrospective today, I've got list of 10 improvements I'd like you guys to address for the next sprints

4
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:23,792
Hey Khara, I'm gonna need you guys to get more work in progress, it's pretty good but you gonna need more stuff than that

5
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:23,891
Ok

6
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,000
Cool, thanks!

7
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:29,594
Awesome, guys! That's our fastest standing up yet, it was only 40 minutes

8
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:30,066
Yeah

9
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:30,957
The point is not getting...

10
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:36,198
I was just reading this and it says Scrum is all that going faster, what's taking you so long?

11
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:38,264
Get back to work...

12
00:00:38,297 --> 00:00:40,924
There is no way this story is a 13, this is more like a 2.

13
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:45,660
Alright, so we'll kick off this retrospective with 5 minutes silent writing

14
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:50,693
Silent writing

15
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:51,825
That's not an impediment

16
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:55,726
As your ScrumMaster and product owner, these are the stories I need you to commit this sprint

17
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:03,231
My computer was stolen during a break in last night, I can't get any work done until I get a new one

18
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:04,726
Have you heard of paper?

19
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:08,495
Adam, I'm gonna need this feature demo this afternoon, you can get it done right?

20
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:09,528
Yeah, no problem

21
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:09,660
Great

22
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:10,594
I'm just gonna add this to your work in progress

23
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:14,825
Continuous integrations never helps anybody,let's skip that

24
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:19,792
Oh no Chris, listen, we're doing Scrum now, so we don't have to share that sort of stuff to the management

25
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:25,132
3 months and management think we can get it done in another sprint, and I just don't understand...

26
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:32,396
Hey guys, surprise! our CEO is joining us for today's retrospective, but just do everything normally...

27
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:36,891
Hey guys, you are totally failing, so I am gonna cut this sprint a couple of days short

28
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:38,726
Where are you going?

29
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,924
Bio?

30
00:01:39,957 --> 00:01:41,792
Do you have a task for that?

31
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:42,099
No

32
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:47,363
Alright guys, you guys are letting our company down this sprint

33
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:53,099
I was just thinking you guys have a lot to do this sprint so let's make this sprint 3 weeks instead of 2, let's just change that

34
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:53,165
Cool

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,726
Disagree or commit?

36
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,660
That's not an impediment

37
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:00,660
So we call this story done?

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,264
That's close enough, you guys have it

39
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:10,495
You guys are doing great this sprint but the other team's velocity is a little bit higher, could you pick it up just a little bit?

40
00:02:10,528 --> 00:02:11,759
5 minutes of silent writing

41
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:28,825
Hey, no it is a fine time, I'm just doing a retrospective, a job at Google? Yeah

42
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:35,924
I'm not gonna be here tomorrow, so if you guys can just do your daily Scrum by email just at whatever time you like, just shoot out email

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,429
That's not an impediment

44
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:42,726
It's great, the other team's velocity is much better than yours, I mean could you guys work late tonight?

45
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:55,330
Check it out, the cats are eating a cheeseburger, it can't be healthy at all
