100:00:03,495	-->	00:00:05,858Tonight, The Deep Dive.
200:00:05,891	-->	00:00:10,033One company's secret weapon for innovation
300:00:22,924	-->	00:00:26,396We went to IDEO, the product design folk
400:00:30,297	-->	00:00:34,330and completely redesign it for us in just 5 days
500:00:34,363	-->	00:00:39,924ABC News correspondent Jack Smith tells us what happened next
600:00:41,000	-->	00:00:45,0999 in the morning, day one and these people have a deadline to meet
700:00:49,561	-->	00:00:52,957This is Palo Alto, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley
800:00:55,594	-->	00:00:59,396probably the most influential product development firm in the world
900:01:06,858	-->	00:01:10,066and the first computer mouse for Apple, Smith ski goggles,
1000:01:10,099	-->	00:01:15,594Nike sunglasses, NEC computer screens, hundreds of products we take for granted
1100:01:15,660	-->	00:01:21,297The point is that we are not actually experts at any given area
1200:01:24,462	-->	00:01:26,330So we don't care if you give us a toothbrush
1300:01:27,693	-->	00:01:29,495a tractor, a space shuttle
1400:01:29,528	-->	00:01:31,066you know, a chair
1500:01:31,099	-->	00:01:32,165It's all the same to us
1600:01:32,198	-->	00:01:37,264We like want to figure out how to innovate and by using our process applying it
1700:01:41,231	-->	00:01:45,363project leader because he's good with groups,not because of seniority
1800:01:45,396	-->	00:01:47,264He's only been at IDEO for 6 years.
1900:01:47,297	-->	00:01:50,825The rest of the team is electric, but that's typical here
2000:01:50,858	-->	00:01:53,033Whitney Mortimer, Harvard MBA
2100:01:53,066	-->	00:01:55,165Peter Coughlan, linguist
2200:01:55,198	-->	00:01:58,198Tom Kelly, Dave's brother, marketing expert
2300:01:58,231	-->	00:02:00,594Jane Fulton-Suri, psychologist
2400:02:00,627	-->	00:02:06,462Alex Kazaks,26, a biology major who's turned down medical school 3 times
2500:02:06,495	-->	00:02:08,825because he's having too much fun at IDEO
2600:02:08,891	-->	00:02:11,924Safety emerges early as an important issue
2700:02:11,957	-->	00:02:17,72622 thousand child injuries a year, which is-- so they're hospitalized injuries.
2800:02:17,759	-->	00:02:19,264I mean there are many others
2900:02:19,297	-->	00:02:22,825And theft. It turns out a lot of carts are stolen
3000:02:22,858	-->	00:02:27,594As the team works, it becomes clear there are no titles here, no permanent assignments
3100:02:27,627	-->	00:02:31,429And the other side says, give us a lot of help, be safe
3200:02:32,957	-->	00:02:36,363I'll give you a big red ball on a post
3300:02:36,396	-->	00:02:37,429and that says you're a big guy
3400:02:37,462	-->	00:02:39,561If you've got a ball you're a senior vice president
3500:02:39,594	-->	00:02:40,957you know, what do I care?
3600:02:41,000	-->	00:02:42,726Or the desk, red ball, it's all the same
3700:02:42,792	-->	00:02:48,066In a very innovative culture you can't have a kind of hierarchy of
3800:02:48,099	-->	00:02:50,594here's the boss and the next person down and the next person down
3900:02:50,627	-->	00:02:53,264and the next person down because it's impossible that
4000:02:53,297	-->	00:02:57,132the boss is the one who's had the insightful experience with shopping carts.
4100:02:57,165	-->	00:02:58,000It's just not possible
4200:02:58,033	-->	00:03:02,561The team spreads into groups to find out firsthand what the people who use
4300:03:02,594	-->	00:03:04,957make and repair shopping carts really think
4400:03:05,000	-->	00:03:06,561Ok, go
4500:03:06,594	-->	00:03:08,429The problem with plastic cart is the wind catches it and
4600:03:11,759	-->	00:03:14,825Oh,man, that's actually a pretty good point.
4700:03:14,858	-->	00:03:20,033The trick is to find these real experts so that you can learn much more quickly than you
4800:03:20,066	-->	00:03:22,396could by just kind of doing it in the normal way
4900:03:22,429	-->	00:03:24,198and trying to learn about it yourself
5000:03:24,231	-->	00:03:26,792From everything I read these things aren't that safe either
5100:03:26,825	-->	00:03:32,231you know, so probably the seat itself is going to have to be redesigned
5200:03:32,264	-->	00:03:36,528One of the interesting things for me is looking at how people really don't like to let go of the cart
5300:03:36,561	-->	00:03:38,132except for the professional shopper
5400:03:38,165	-->	00:03:41,165whose strategy is to leave the cart at various places
5500:03:41,198	-->	00:03:44,693Three thirty in the afternoon and the group is back at IDEO
5600:03:44,726	-->	00:03:46,495There is no let up
5700:03:46,528	-->	00:03:52,330Each team is going to demonstrate and communicate and share everything that they've learned today
5800:03:52,363	-->	00:03:58,231A shopping cart has been clocked at 35 miles an hour traveling through a parking lot in the wind
5900:03:58,264	-->	00:03:59,198We were in the store, what
6000:03:59,231	-->	00:04:03,561two hours and it was truly frightening just to see the kind of stuff going on
6100:04:03,594	-->	00:04:08,099You ought to designate some people to make damn sure that the store owner's point of view is represented
6200:04:08,132	-->	00:04:12,660After nine straight hours, the team is tired. They call it a day
6300:04:12,693	-->	00:04:15,000Is everybody cool?
6400:04:15,033	-->	00:04:17,363Well, that's great. Thanks a lot. And we had a great time today
6500:04:17,429	-->	00:04:24,066IDEO's mantra for innovation is written everywhere
6600:04:24,099	-->	00:04:29,264one conversation at a time, stay focused, encourage wild ideas
6700:04:29,297	-->	00:04:32,330defer judgement, build on the ideas of others
6800:04:32,363	-->	00:04:39,627That's hardest thing for people to do is to restrain themselves from criticizing an idea
6900:04:39,660	-->	00:04:42,165So if anybody starts to nail an idea, they get the bell
7000:04:42,198	-->	00:04:47,099The ideas pour out and are posted on the walls
7100:04:47,132	-->	00:04:49,297Oh, the blind, the privacy blind
7200:04:49,330	-->	00:04:52,462Like when you're buying 6 cases of condoms and you don't want them to see
7300:04:52,495	-->	00:04:55,132If it doesn't nest, we don't have a solution
7400:04:55,165	-->	00:05:00,264Organized chaos. It's not organized. What it is is it's focused chaos
7500:05:00,297	-->	00:05:05,693Vote with your post, it's not with an idea that's cool, but with an idea that's cool and buildable
7600:05:05,726	-->	00:05:11,429If it's too far out there and it can't be build in a day then I don't think we should vote on it
7700:05:11,462	-->	00:05:15,825Enlightened trial and error succeeds over the planning of the lone genius
7800:05:15,858	-->	00:05:20,066Enlightened trial and error succeeds over the planning of the lone genius
7900:05:20,099	-->	00:05:23,825If anything sums up IDEO's approach, that is it
8000:05:23,858	-->	00:05:26,462Worried that the team is drifting
8100:05:26,495	-->	00:05:32,693what can only be called a group of self-appointed adults under Dave Kelly holds an informal side session
8200:05:32,726	-->	00:05:33,693Four, four or five
8300:05:33,726	-->	00:05:38,000Four of five teams, and we give each team a need area
8400:05:38,033	-->	00:05:44,264It becomes very autocratic for a short period of time in defining what things people are going to work on
8500:05:44,297	-->	00:05:47,561If you don't work under time constraints you could never get anything done
8600:05:47,594	-->	00:05:49,759because it's a messy process that can go on forever
8700:05:49,792	-->	00:05:53,660Back at the shop it is 6 o'clock
8800:05:53,693	-->	00:05:55,792The four mockups are ready for showing
8900:05:55,825	-->	00:06:01,165Baskets also can be, if you think you will have more volume, baskets can be put in
9000:06:01,198	-->	00:06:04,561A modular shopping cart you pile hard baskets onto
9100:06:04,594	-->	00:06:08,627A high tech cart that gets you through the traffic jam at check out
9200:06:08,660	-->	00:06:13,759That you could mount a scanner on the shopping cart so that you as the customer
9300:06:13,792	-->	00:06:18,066as you pull it off the shelf, would scan each item
9400:06:18,099	-->	00:06:25,462One that's build around child safety and another that lets shoppers talk to supermarket staff remotely
9500:06:25,495	-->	00:06:27,495Yeah, where can I find the yogurt?
9600:06:27,528	-->	00:06:36,066But the adults again decide more work needs to be done before the mockups can be combined into one last prototype
9700:06:36,099	-->	00:06:38,693Why don't we have all the carts come up here for a second?
9800:06:38,726	-->	00:06:44,759I think you take a piece of each one of these ideas and kind of back it off a little bit and then put it in the design
9900:06:44,792	-->	00:06:47,066The design is still not there
10000:06:47,099	-->	00:06:48,957But there's another motto at IDEO
10100:06:49,000	-->	00:06:51,627fail often in order to succeed sooner
10200:06:51,660	-->	00:06:57,330and some of the team will be up half the night trying to put together a design finally  that does work
10300:06:57,363	-->	00:06:59,033Here it is!
10400:07:01,000	-->	00:07:05,495So we took the best elements out of each prototype
10500:07:05,528	-->	00:07:09,396The cart, which is designed to cost about the same as today's carts
10600:07:09,429	-->	00:07:11,759is different in every other way
10700:07:11,792	-->	00:07:12,528What do you think?
10800:07:12,561	-->	00:07:17,396Well, I'm very proud of the team. I think it's great
10900:07:17,429	-->	00:07:18,561This, does this work for you?
11000:07:18,594	-->	00:07:20,858It works for me great. It's also beautiful
11100:07:20,891	-->	00:07:24,495The cart's wheels turn 90 degrees so it can move sideways
11200:07:24,528	-->	00:07:26,891No more lifting up the rear in a tight spot
11300:07:26,924	-->	00:07:30,000And you shop in a totally different way
11400:07:30,033	-->	00:07:33,264The bags are hung on the hooks on the cart's frame
11500:07:33,297	-->	00:07:35,495Remember there is no basket here
11600:07:35,528	-->	00:07:38,000At first I was a little shocked
11700:07:38,033	-->	00:07:41,099but I think it's you have some fantastic ideas here
11800:07:41,132	-->	00:07:44,264It needs a little refining but I think that it's great
11900:07:44,297	-->	00:07:45,726I mean we would want them
12000:07:45,759	-->	00:07:49,132And she also gave us some really good comments about how we can make this thing better
12100:07:49,198	-->	00:07:50,726A lot of hours
12200:07:50,759	-->	00:07:56,561Also an open mind, a boss who demands fresh ideas be quirky and clash with his
12300:07:56,594	-->	00:08:00,825a belief that chaos can be constructive and teamwork
12400:08:00,858	-->	00:08:02,858a great deal of teamwork
12500:08:02,891	-->	00:08:07,264And these are the recipe for how innovation takes place
12600:08:07,297	-->	00:08:11,792This is Jack Smith for Nightline, Palo Alto, California
